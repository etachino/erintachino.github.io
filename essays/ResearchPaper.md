Erin Tachino: Introduction
Compensation can come in many different forms. Overall compensation means wages paid to employees by employers for work performed. Compensation can also be short-term or long-term incentives for employees. Compensation can be base pay, variable pay, and differential pay. Personnel compensation is covered by all these different types of pay (SHRM, 2021). When employees work hard for a company; providing extra compensation to recognize the work that an employee has put in, can be extremely beneficial to the company. When a company gives meaningful compensation for employees' work it creates a strong relationship between the two. No one wants to be underappreciated.
When a company offers compensation, it is important for the company to know their limits. Having great benefits for employees is amazing but a company needs to make sure that these benefits are feasible for the company to offer. Compensation falls under the Human resources department of the company. They are the ones who create a compensation plan or create incentive compensation. Creating reachable goals for employees that are still in the company's budget is the trick. Working for bigger companies there is a larger incentive compensation so smaller companies need to be creative in compensation.
History of the Development of Compensation
Compensation isn’t always about rewards; it can also be for work related injuries. Workers’ compensation became very prevalent during the industrial revolution. Many people were working with dangerous machinery, and some got severely hurt. Some injuries were so bad that people couldn’t return to work. Companies weren’t being held accountable for these injuries and many people who were hurt got zero help from their employers. In the 1800s, there were a few laws that protected the companies from workers who were injured on the job.
2
 
The 3 laws were, Contributory negligence, "Fellow servant" doctrine, and Assumption risk (The Hartford, 2021). These laws made it extremely hard for the employees to prove that the liability should fall on the company. These laws even had the nickname known as the “unholy trinity of defenses”. Contributory negligence made it so even if the work conditions were awful as one could imagine; if an employee were to slip and lose an arm, they would not be liable to any compensation from the company. This law was established because of the Martin v. Wabash Railroad case. In this case the freight conductor fell off his train, inspectors ruled it to be a loose handrail, but the company argued under contributory negligence; that inspection of the train and any faulty equipment was part of the conductors duties. The train conductor did not get any compensation due to this.
Fellow servant doctrine states that if an employee gets hurt by another employee the company will not give any compensation to the injured employee (The Hartford, 2021). This made it almost impossible for an injured employee to make a case against the company. Many factors at the time where all assembly lines so normally injuries would come from another employee because all the tasks were intertwined with one another. Lastly, we have assumption risk. Assumption risk is probably the worst out of the 3 laws. This is because it states that employees knew and accepted all risks involved with the job when signing the contract (The Hartford, 2021). In order to work for these companies’ employees were required to sign the contracts that released the employees’ rights to sue if they got hurt on the job. Many people during this time called these contracts “workers’ rights to die” or “death contracts”. A lot of these workers who were injured and unable to return weren’t fighting for just the money from the compensation but fighting for their families to be able to survive with one person in the house
3
                 
unable to work. Companies were handing off the blame to others and dodging paying employee compensation for the injuries sustained at work.
It wasn’t till the early 1990s that workers finally saw laws getting passed to compensate them for injuries sustained at work. The first group of people that got compensation rights were railroad workers. In 1908 the Federal Employers Liability Act was enacted, this allowed railroad workers to claim compensation if they prove negligence for their injury (Iowa Orthopaedic Journal, 2021). This was the beginning of workers compensation. In today's modern day most states require employers to have compensation insurance for their workers. This ensures that any worker under this employer will get access to compensation if they were hurt on the job.
Wells Fargo Case Study
Now let's look at a case study of the misuse of personnel compensation. The case that is being covered is the Wells Fargo scam. This case was one of the biggest fraud cases for a bank in the United States. Wells Fargo is one of the most well-known and profitable banks in America. They have been around since the mid 1800s, founded in New York, NY. In 2016 Wells Fargo had about 269,100,000 employees. Compared to other banks in America, Wells Fargo is ranked number #3 in America. About 70 million people in the country use this bank for their finances. This scam all started when employees were told to meet quotas and were paid extra for meeting or exceeding the goals for the quota.
In 2016, it came to light that Wells Fargo encouraged employees to create unauthorized accounts under their customers' names. These unsuspecting customers would not be notified about the new account because employees were using their personal contact information when opening these unauthorized accounts. Over 2 million fake accounts were reported to be created. Wells Fargo did not gain any revenue from these accounts, the employees simply did this so they
4
   
would get the incentive compensation (Barro, J, 2016). To create these unauthorized accounts employees were taking small amounts of money from the current accounts of its customers and putting it into the new unauthorized accounts. Once quotas were met the employee would then close the unauthorized accounts and put the money back into the original account. Wells Fargo admitted this scam took place from 2002 to 2016.
This case sheds light on how important it is to ensure that incentive compensation is implemented and monitored correctly. Incentive compensation programs can be very beneficial for the company and the employees. Managers must make sure that these incentive compensations don’t deviate from its intended purpose. When it does deviate from its original purpose it can damage the organization reputation and image. Making sure these incentives compensations are monitored and measured overtime isn’t just to see if the program is being misused, it can also give the company data. The data that can come from monitoring the incentive compensations will tell the company if these incentives are making a difference in revenues. Such as are the employees being motivated by these incentives or are these the right incentives that the employees want to work hard for. By tracking and monitoring the compensation program, the company can find if the incentives aren’t being used. Then from there the company can figure out why employees aren’t motivated to meet the goals or if the goals are intangible at this time. After this data is collected the company can find solutions to why these incentives are working and they can shift their incentives to align better for the employees.
How Technology has Impacted Compensation
Being able to retain this type of data has revolutionized the way companies operate. Technology has greatly impacted personnel compensation. Nowadays with everything being on
5
 
the internet it makes processing documents, keeping statements on record, and compensation trackable. Before everything would be filed and sent up to another department for processing but now the Human resource department can request or submit documents in a matter of seconds Beqom. (2021, May 21). There are many parts to releasing compensation to employees, being able to keep track of each employee's papers and statements makes this process a lot simpler. This allows the company to reduce the margin of error that can occur when processing compensation. Many companies today are world-wide with employees who are working from different locations. Technology bridges this locational gap. It allows the company to process paperwork that is sent from thousands of miles away.
Processing paperwork using technology isn’t the only benefit that technology allows a company to do. Such as the concept mentioned earlier about using technology to track incentive compensation. Not only can technology help measure incentive compensation for companies, but it also can measure pay, promotional rises and remedial adjustments. Having this technology that can track these things can help the company ensure that its employees are getting fair and competitive pay and rises. This helps companies with the retention of its employees. Without having technology to be able to track all these different factors the Human Resources departments would be overwhelmed with the amount of paperwork.
Compensation can differ from quarter to quarter, there is some compensation that is instilled in the company's values and will not change. To keep up with present market value the Human Resource department must constantly re-strategizing every time there is a shift in the market value. Many companies offer stocks as a compensatory method. So, ensuring that the company is dividing up the stocks correctly is a key strategy. The Human Resource department would spend hours constantly watching or any changes within the market. With technology now
6

the Human Resource department has easy access to tracking any changes. Being able to stay ahead of the ever-changing market allows the Human Resource department to ensure all employees are getting the correct compensation; this minimizes the amount of employee pay complaints.
Technology also allows employees easy access to compensation benefits. Many companies have a website specialized to their company. The online database allows current and new employees to review and sign documents, look at their personal history statements, check hours/schedules, look at past paycheck stubs, access benefit information and view the company’s mission and values. About 30 years ago almost all of this was on paper and would be in file cabinets. Now with technology all this can be accessed by one's home computer. People don’t even have to go into work to check. When employees can access compensation information it benefits them and the company. With technology it allows the company to be more transparent with their employees. Being able to access all this information takes some weight off the Human resources department shoulders. Many questions can be answered through this specialized database.
This research paper will cover personnel compensation and all the different parts that make up compensation. We will take a deep drive into different cases about how different companies have handled compensation. There are many different types of compensation, and this paper will cover all the different types; and how they can be beneficial or negative to a company's success. We believe that ensuring proper compensation is an important factor to the success of a company. In today’s modern world companies can use technology to their advantage. There are many ways that technology has enabled compensation plans to become the best for employees and employers. Throughout this paper we will see how different types of
7

technology are implemented into the compensation process. Compensation for employees is how companies can express their gratitude for their employees' hard work; creating the correct compensation is key.
Hannah Li: Incentive Pay as Motivation
As discussed earlier, personnel compensation is the combination of salaries, wages, and benefits that employees receive from their employer. Personnel compensation includes salary along with benefits and bonuses. The largest sum payments employees will receive is their salary and is usually the initial number that attracts employees to jobs, but that compensation number rises with the bonuses awarded. Not all positions and employers offer bonuses or incentive pay, but the inclusion or potential of earning one is an enticing benefit to employees on top of their salary pay. As literally stated in the term, incentive pay is designed to motivate employees and is an incentive to do their best work to achieve these bonuses. The commonality of incentive pay has grown extensively in the past decades with salary negotiations and compensation plans expanding to attract and retain employees. This section will discuss incentive pay as a source of employee motivation, types of bonuses, how it is determined and rewarded, and its effectiveness as a means of incentive.
What is Incentive Pay?
Incentive pay is defined as a financial or non-monetary reward offered to employees for performance rather than the total number of hours worked. It is used as a motivational tool to boost morale and ensure employees perform at their best (Benstead, 2018). It is important to note that companies are not required to provide incentive pay for their employees as it is at the discretion of the organization. Incentive pay, more widely known as bonuses come in many
8
 
forms, the most common being monetary payments. Organizations offer incentive pay to boost productivity, increase sales, retain employees, and increase morale (Betterteam, 2021). Incentive pay can be rewarded to outstanding performing employees or whole teams, varying by the organization since bigger companies are able to offer more incentive bonuses since they have more funds to reward and invest in their employees. Bigger organizations, especially those with a large number of employees are more likely to introduce incentive pay as motivation and incentive to reach company goals. Implementation of such incentive pay plans would increase revenue in the organization and the bonuses provided for employees that made this happen is in a way, a return on investment. Theoretically, incentive pay such as bonuses encourages employees to perform better and achieve company goals, but this is not always the case.
Types of Incentive Pay
There are different types of incentives, casual and structured incentives. Though both
casual and structured incentives can include monetary rewards, the two vary in structure. Casual incentives are given to employees at any time for high performance or to retain employees. Casual incentive rewards are more sporadic and given when deemed appropriate. Additionally, the rewards given can include non-monetary items such as small gifts, meals, or gift cards. Meanwhile, structured incentives are set according to specific goals and paid at a percentage rate. In comparison to casual incentives, structured incentives can be seen as more consistent. Rewards to structured incentives include company stock, paid time off, commission, and year- end bonuses (Betterteam, 2021 ). Structured incentives are also a way to retain employees, for example, many organizations offer company stock after a certain amount of time spent at the organization, and time off and year-end bonus amounts increase with the time spent at the company.

How is Incentive Pay Calculated?
One of the more meticulous parts of an incentive plan is calculating the bonus pay, and
working with numbers and percentages of the payment. These details are established by employers at the beginning of a payment period or during a negotiation. The measurement of whether one should be rewarded the bonus and the amount is determined by the achievement of the goal. Let's start off with a single employee bonus calculation, sales-based incentives. For example, if an employee made fifty thousand dollars in sales for the year, and their sales incentive bonus is ten percent, the employee’s incentive payment would be five thousand dollars. This sales-based incentive as such motivates employees to make more sales because, in return, they get a percentage of the sales, this method is also known as commission. A sales-based incentive is reliant on a single employee’s work and performance, department bonuses rely on a whole team of workers’ performances and outcomes. Organizations usually issue goals to specific departments and once the goal is accomplished, the incentive payment is rewarded and split amongst the team. Calculations for department goal pay can be simple as well, for example, if the department incentive pay is fifteen thousand dollars and there are eight employees in the team, each employee will receive $1875 as their incentive bonus. Complications can arise from this if members of the team did not contribute to the goal equally (Indeed, 2021). As for the non- monetary goals mentioned earlier such as extra paid days off, small gifts, or even work flexibility, there is no specific calculation for these incentives. Non-monetary incentive rewards are given by availability and are determined by tracking company expenses (Payscale, 2021). Effectiveness of Incentive Pay
Incentive Pay and bonuses are always desirable to employees and many employers are willing to offer them the encouragement it induces, but this strategy does not always work in
10
  
favor of the organization and the possibility of failure lingers. The advantages of offering incentive pay include overall happier employees, better employee performance and retention, better organizational performance, and helping execute business strategy (Wiebush, 2022). These advantages can be viewed as cause and effect, happier employees lead to better companies. Incentive pay makes for happier employees which keeps staff motivated and increases job satisfaction and morale in the organization. This increased morale leads to better employee performance and retention, happier employees are less likely to leave the organization, and establishes loyalty to the organization. With a combination of high-performing employees and long-term employees, the organization continues to do well which is why incentive pay for employees is commonly discussed in compensation negotiations.
Though incentive pay is generally viewed in a positive light, many experts and high business leaders doubt the effectiveness of incentive pay. Arguments against the effectiveness of incentive pay include the belief that pay is not a motivator, rewards are manipulative, rewards rupture relationships, discourage risk-taking, and undermine interest (Kohn, 2014). By applying behaviorist theory, the effectiveness of incentive compensation can be debunked by identifying human motivators and organizational behaviors. Surveys have found that there is no solid evidence that pay increases would in relation increase work effort. Additionally, there is also the possibility that the employee does not reach their goal to be awarded the bonus. Federick Herzberg, a distinguished business professor, argues that this result can be felt like a punishment, as not receiving a reward one had expected to receive is also indistinguishable from being punished. Another downside of incentive pay is that incentive pay ruptures relationships. When employees are all competing for limited rewards, the pressure for individual gain increases. Given that organizational success is very reliant on cohesive teamwork, an environment where
11

employees are competing against each other for a bonus eliminates the quality of cooperation that holds up the organization. Additionally, incentive pay discourages risk-taking, when employees are competing for a bonus, people tend to stick to the rules to eliminate the risk of mistakes and not receiving the bonus (Kohn, 2014). Contrary to popular belief, incentive pay is not always the best motivation for employees and organizations put effectiveness and relationships at risk if choosing to organize a bonus system.
Given the benefits and drawbacks of incentive pay, the choice to establish an incentive pay system is ultimately up to the employer. If an organization is seeking to attract and retain happy employees, an incentive pay plan may be appropriate but may risk a lack of creativity and slow organizational growth.
Incentive Pay Trends
Organizational structure and workplace environments are constantly changing, especially in an era where employees have higher leverage in their positions. Along with these changing times, incentive pay and compensation are expected to change as well. Thanks to the progressive Millennial generation, “spot bonus” programs saw a significant increase in 2021. Spot bonuses are given upon completion of projects or assignments, giving immediate recognition and award to the employee or team (Carver, 2021). Another incentive pay trends that are predicted are more frequent bonuses, many organizations have already started awarding bonuses at the end of shorter terms. Rather than the traditional annual reward, incentive pay is being more frequently rewarded monthly or quarterly (Miller, 2020). These short-term incentives can be a consistent way to motivate employees to reach long-term goals through persistent recognition and bonuses. Another incentive pay trend influenced by the increasing competitiveness of the job market is long-term cash incentives. As the demand for certain roles and positions increases, tempting
12
 
employees to leave current roles for positions at other organizations. Long-term incentives are tied to short-term incentives where a percentage of the short-term incentive award is deferred and is to be awarded after a longer period of time as long as the participating employee remains employed throughout the incentive period (Carver, 2021). According to these predictions for the future of incentive pay, the company awarded bonuses do not seem to be slowing down and will continue to be a norm and part of employee compensation.
Hewlett-Packard Case Study
The Hewlett-Packard Company or better known as HP is an American technology company. In the mid-1990s, the company introduced a pay-for-performance plan in hopes to boost performance within the company. Pay-for-performance aimed to make an organization less hierarchical and more competitive, focused, adaptable and collaborative. At the time, surveys reported that companies actively using pay-for-performance programs showed twice the shareholder returns as those who were not actively using these programs (Beer & Cannon, 2004). Hewlett-Packard Co. tested this method with certain employees from November 1, 2000, to April 30, 2001 (Hewlett-Packard Company, 2000). If successful, the company will continue to utilize this plan in hopes to achieve the same results as other successful companies but this did not end too well for HP. The test plan was applied to teams tying ten to twenty percent of an employee’s compensation to their team’s performance. The incentive goals were categorized into three levels, with an expected ninety percent of employees being able to reach level one goals, fifty percent of employees were expected to be able to reach level two, and ten to fifteen percent for level three goals. The experiment resulted in good performance from the employees and almost all teams were able to reach levels two and three. Due to its success, managers at HP raised the goal expectations along with the incentive pay. This is where problems began to arise, with cash
13
 
as the incentive, workers began focusing on achieving this monetary bonus instead of doing the many other things that would help the company. Eventually, this system was scrapped by the managers at HP (Beer & Cannon, 2004). A few flaws that kept HP’s incentive system from being successful was that the bonuses were awkward by the team, not every individual in a team will contribute an equal amount of work, some will do more and some will do less, this was not fair considering the bonus amount would have been split evenly amongst the team. Another flaw is that the employees were too focused on the bonus; it didn't leave room for other contributions to the company, or in other words, didn't leave room for creative risks to be taken. Lastly, this severed relationships between team members and relationships among teams since they were all competing for the cash incentives. As I've mentioned earlier, companies are only successful with teamwork and cohesiveness. Hewlett-Packard’s incentive pay experiment is a lesson to all organizations that the more you focus people on monetary incentives and use money as a motive, the more disruption there will be in the company.
Fharoh Omick: Cross-Cultural Differences within Compensation
This paper has introduced concepts of compensation; however, how does this translate into environments of cross-cultures? It is well known that environments with many cultures need higher engagement and understanding. This is due to the differences in cultural expectations, practices, and routines. For example, if many people within a company value collectivism, then managers may prefer team-performance-based pay rather than merit-based pay. Given the dynamic company culture, we explore the different expectations of compensation, compensation management, and how the emergence of information technology (IT) jobs has brought a discussion of compensation practices into question, and how this relates to cross-cultural topics. Lastly, a Japanese pay case study concerning seniority-pay (nenko joretsu).
14

Compensation Differences within Culture
To begin, we look at how beliefs in specific countries affect compensation ideas, compensation cultures, the different compensation systems, and the cultural differences in employee benefits. The critical point to understand is that not all compensation programs are equally acceptable around the world. An example is Wal-Mart’s unwillingness to establish an egalitarian German wage-setting practice (Frank, 2015). The issue is that firms assume that business compensation systems are effectively the same as their base of operations. However, this is a detrimental assumption that can lead to disastrous effects. Focusing on the individual attitudes to compensation, we analyze European countries and the United States. More specifically, we are looking at how each country varies in the allocation and distribution of resources to individuals, in both fiscal and payment systems. Frank (2015) notes that European countries have a history of aristocratic systems that created an attitude of not valuing the link between effort and reward. However, in the United States, it is quite the opposite as people aspire for the “American Dream,” and believe that hard work pays off in the end. An interesting comparison that perpetuates this idea of cultural attitudes is in China. In ancient China, due to high levels of rice- farming practices, led to a more collectivistic culture that persists today (Frank, 2015). These differences highlight the interplay between social structures and on the flipside, values, beliefs, and attitudes. These comparisons can reach a level that affects individuals' viewpoints of fairness. A study found that “only 30% of Americans believe that luck plays a bigger role than effort in determining income, whereas 54% of Europeans believe that luck is more important” (Frank, 2015, p. 161). The article mentions this may explain why there is a higher income inequality tolerance in America than in Europe. What this means is that people perceive their
15
 
high gains of wealth as the fruits of their labor rather than the lucky decisions and crossroads they may have been presented with. Additionally, this explains the cultural attitude differences as Europeans are less fond of high-income inequalities. Evident in the fact that “U.S. chief executives’ compensation was 325 times the average worker’s pay in 2010; for European companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, the ratio of CEO to average worker pay was 115 times” (Frank, 2015, p. 161). Next, focusing on why specific compensation systems may not work within specific cultures due to the topics mentioned. What has been described are known as “Just World Beliefs,” which means the fundamental psychological beliefs of inherent fairness in the world (Frank, 2015). Essentially, as detailed prior, each culture has its concept of fairness which can explain the compensation systems to some degree. Furthermore, these differences are studied to be negatively correlated. Frank (2015, p. 165) analyzes “that preferences for individual compensation systems are not merely strategically driven by people’s beliefs about their expectations to perform well in the task” Rather, the different cultural backgrounds encompass the differences found in the preference in individual-based systems or performance-based systems. This critical point is important to note as this illustrates that inherent cultural beliefs can shape how individuals view compensation and their preferences.
These psychological beliefs are all but intangible and can be compromised through thorough management. This next section shows how strategic compensation management can differ from organization to organization but can be an effective method to handle cultural differences. Additionally, we discuss how compensation strategies are affected by culture through empirical research. One method is that variable pay has been more encouraged through progressive firms. The primary use of variable-based schemes is to increase employee
16

productivity and performance. This is through the use of individual, group, or organizational bonuses, incentives, profit sharing, or other pay-for-performance methods (Mishra, 2012). As the new wave of compensation systems slowly innovates the business world, there are specific cultural compensations. We begin with the different cultures of compensation management and the compensation strategies associated with them. There are four cultures, apathetic, paternalistic, demanding, and involvement. We begin with apathetic which means there is no place for strategic compensation as there is no focus on people or improvement of performance. These include seniority rules, which will be discussed later on, promotions are slow and automatic and performance management are rare (Mishra, 2012). Next is a paternalistic culture which has less concern with performance as most organizations meet employees' needs such as daycare, flex time, etc. Therefore, it carries the least priority in these organizations. A demanding culture is a strategic culture that is most valued and focuses on efficiency, competition, and individual performance which drives compensation of employees. Lastly, is involvement culture which includes the core values of both people and performance. They involve both fixed and strategic compensation as both individual performance and team considerations carry equal weightage. Compensation is orientated on both fixed and incentives (Mishra, 2012). Keeping into consideration that these are all cultures of compensation, in contemporary human resource management it is accepted that compensation packages, training, and development will benefit in the long run. (Mishra, 2012). However, international businesses must find a common ground, this is due to the differential factor of compensation. This means that managers should make up for the differences in currency valuation, standards of living, lifestyle norms, and so on.
17

These cultures of strategic compensation management are laid out to complete our understanding of how to conduct compensation packages and methods. At this point, this paper has not defined which practice is the most effective but rather illustrated the direction in which would be most beneficial for managers in the long run. Bridging off from the strategic cultures, we analyze the roles of culture in developing compensation strategies. Bear in mind that the relation of the strategic cultures will be compared within empirical evidence of compensation strategies. A notable difference is benefits provided to employees than their base salary. The four practices in question are flexible benefit plans, workplace child-care programs, career-break schemes, and maternity programs. (Schuler, 1998). Firms that promote these qualities of life benefits are societies with high femininity as they take into consideration of employees’ personal and social needs and their lives outside of work. (Schuler, 1988). Furthermore, countries with high uncertainty avoidance emphasize predictability and security in career planning, also workday schedules. Therefore, it allows employees to deal with unpredictable situations. (Schuler, 1998). Uncertainty avoidance defines as how cultures differ in the amount of tolerance they have for unpredictability. It is concluded that the benefits stated before will be offered in countries that have high levels of uncertainty avoidance. Focusing on different benefits, in Germany employers reimburse their executives for their car expenses, while in Japan they may get a car plus expenses. Also, British companies, typically provide a company car for managers. While the United States provides free health care benefits (Mishra, 2012). Within China managers are expected to be hard-working, involved, and lead by example. As their base salary is low but is provided many benefits, such as housing, transportation, meals, clothing, etc. As
18

foreign firms value salary more than benefits and this is becoming more widely sought. (Mishra, 2012).
Technology and How it Affected Compensation in IT Firms.
Technology is a highly volatile market within the world and is ever-changing. With these high levels of change, how does compensation reflect these changes? Wang (2019) begins with a case study of an IT firm in Taiwan and analyzes its compensation strategies. He notes that they serve nonmonetary rewards which include selecting their titles, providing training programs for three months, and then a potential pay raise after three months and language courses for English. Furthermore, flextime is granted to employees within tech firms. This is due to the rise of technology and allowing employees not required to be in the office during traditional hours. They can work from home or complete work over the computer within the time they feel they are the most productive. This is an example of a paternalistic culture. Compared to the other firms that they analyzed which are not within the IT field, they faced a rigid bureaucratic system, did not utilize strategic IT compensation, or had an emphasis on competitive negotiable pay which caused frustrations. (Wang, 2019). The cultural aspect that affects this case study is that training IT talents at a reduced pay level is common for smaller IT firms in Taiwan. It is noted that the social feature of conformity to groups in a collective culture, where IT talents are more loyal to firms and hesitant to switch (Wang, 2019). While in the US firm where commitment to capitalism is prevailing, competitive negotiation compensation is also emphasized. Furthermore, Taiwan is a society with a high level of power distance, so nonmonetary rewards can be just as valuable as monetary rewards.
19
 
Case Study: Hitachi Ltd, Seniority-pay
It is evident that cross-cultural differences are prevalent within international firms and
these differences can increase uncertainty. One practice of compensation that is prevalent within all cultures is seniority-based pay (nenko joretsu). While this pay practice is slowly being rejected by the next generation, there are still some implicit implications within firms. What this means is that those who have been employed the longest are seen as more loyal regardless of younger employee skill sets. This compensation system is part of the apathetic culture which highlights management failures of compensation. However, we will focus more on the context of Japan, as this practice is still widely used within the larger companies in Japanese business. We focus on one business Hitachi Ltd, which has recently dropped the seniority pay practices. Hitachi Ltd is a 110-year-old conglomerate that focuses on infrastructure and related digital services. Around 2020 is when the new pay system of merit pay due to the considerable number of people mismatching their positions (Yamazaki, 2020). The system will be adopted by laying out job descriptions for its domestic workforce and using it as a criterion for performance assessments that are linked to pay (Yamazaki, 2020). They noted that seniority-based pay made sense within the manufacturing training grounds as new hires were taught how to make specific equipment, therefore has transferred over the white-collar workers (Yamazaki, 2020). Essentially, Japanese firms based in Japan are faced with high numbers of seniority-based pay due to the lack of transition and innovation of compensation systems. As stated in multiple sources mentioned within this paper, it brings a lack of management and slower promotions within the company.

Gage Lee: Strategic Employee Recognition
Variable pay systems
One of the biggest ways to retain employees and keep them happy is to compensate,
reward, and recognize them. When an employee puts in their hard work for a company, of course they would like to be acknowledged for that in some way. The use of variable pay programs is one of the ways to show and give back to your employee as an employer. Variable pay programs include many different types of ways to give back. This can be bonus or commission plans, group incentive plans, individual bonus plans, and many more. Variable pay plans are compensation programs that deliver lump-sum payments to individuals based on their performance or predetermined objectives of the organization, business unit, and/or individual (Wilson, 2003, pg 172). All of these overarch one of the main reasons for such plans, driving total organizational success.
There are quite a few different ways that variable pay programs can be administered. Excluding discretionary bonus plans, retention bonuses, spot award programs, there are eleven different types of plan and incentives. The first type of plan is profit sharing plans. Profit sharing plans are when a company shares its profits with its employees. This type of plan is one of the oldest and one of the most widely used types of plan because of how simple it is and its ability for employers to contribute to retirement plans and 401(k) plans. The second type of plan is executive annual bonus plans. This type of plan allows senior executives to receive monetary compensation based on individual and company performance.
The third type of plan is management bonus plans. Management bonus plans are similar to executive annual bonus plans in which workers receive a payment based on individual and company performance. The biggest difference is that this is a plan for middle to upper level
