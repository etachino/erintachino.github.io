  - My expirence with the BrowserHistory1,2,3 
---

When I started BrowserHistory1 I first started by watching the introduction video about how to set up my browserhistory. After that, I tried my first attempt with just following the steps to creating the website. In the beginning of the class I did have a hard time getting the server to turn on. After troubleshooting a few times I was able to get the server on. Something that really stumped me during the first Browserhistory was creating the table of contents. Combining the list function and the hyperlink function to work was confusing to me. I had to watch the screencast example to get me started with creating the correct table of contents. After practicing a few times when I recorded myself, I was able to finish in under 15 minutes. This first WOD really helped me understand how to create a basic webpage. Inputting the hyperlinks for the website was something that was on the easier side for me during BrowserHistory1. 

Moving onto BrowserHistory2 this one was quite easy for me and I was able to finish it within the Rx time. I only had to practice a couple times before getting it down. Adding the edits like the background color and margin sizes were relatively simple. One issue that I did have with this BrowserHistory was linking the style sheet to the HTML and ensuring that I had the write font. I wasnâ€™t able to find where the font link was. I had to use the screencast to get the link for the Oswald and Open Sans font. Now moving forward to BrowserHistory3. This BrowserHistory did take me some time to go over the screencast video. I have never used the navbar function before so I needed to practice at least four times before being confident enough to film. I had trouble with how to get the links to be spaced out correctly. It was really cool to learn how using the navbar function with the style.css was able to manipulate the navbar I created in the index.html. This was also my first time moving around images so that they align correctly on the webpage. It was interesting to play around with the margin spaces and how to define where the images go using the float function. Once I was able to understand what functions I needed to use for this WOD I was able to complete it within the allotted time for the Rx.
