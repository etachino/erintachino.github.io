  - The reason why I chose MIS as my major 
---

The reason I choose MIS as my second major is because I believe that it will further my career in business. The world is constantly changing and technology is a huge contributor to this. My other degree is in Human Resources and so many of the functions that HR does for companies use information systems. I believe that with the MIS degree I can combine both of my degrees and have the option to work at a HRIS company. I also chose this major to challenge myself. I am not the best with computers and I want to turn this weakness into a strength. This is my senior year for my undergraduate and I want to make the most of college by setting myself up for success.
