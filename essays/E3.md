<b> Summary of tasks needed to do for WODs BH6, SmartPhoneProducts1, and Invoice1 </b>

<p> I am going to give a brief summary of what I did for each WOD. Starting with BrowserHistory6 we were tasked with making our BrowserHistory3 into a dynamic webpage. The first thing we needed to do was change the navbar to buttons. And we used the “<li> tag to create a list and used type = button. Then we had to create html files for each web browser page, chrome.html, ie.html, and firefox.html. Now we have to copy the stylesheet into each html file we created, this is so that it will link the stylesheet we created earlier into each file. Then in our main index.html we had to add the command “onmouseover” for the images, we also had to link the “img src” so that when it was clicked the img it would pull the img link from the browser html we created. After that we also had to add “onmouseclick” so that when the button is clicked it will take the user to the other html files of the browsers with the paragraph. Now for SmartPhoneProducts1 we are tasked with linking an html file we created with a js file. The js file is where the html file will be pulling all the information. So the first thing we did for this was copy the data that was given on SmartPhoneProducts1. We add this data to the header. Then we had to use the search option to replace all “<h2>, <p>, and <img> with the given document.write code. After that we had to make sure all of these linked up with the correct number, such as name1, name2, ect. Then we created a file js and moved the data we first inserted into the file html header. Inside this js file we were tasked to add a console.log(Products Variables loaded…) so it will show up within the console. Then to link the products.js into the html file we inserted the scr into the script tag where we took out the original data. Our page should look the same but when opening up the console it should state what we wrote for console.log. For the last WOD, Invoice1 we were tasked with creating a dynamic table. So first we had to add comments into the invoice html file we created. Then we had to list out the products we needed to add. We created 5 of these product variables since we have 5 products. Then we had to change it so that each product so that all the variables had their corresponding values, 1-5. Then we add more comments to ensure that we knew what product we were working with. Then we needed to get the subtotal so we had to create a variable so that we could get each product's extended variable. We did the same to get the tax and total. Then we had to add the table into our body. We could use different methods to create a string for each product. I used the document.write code to do this. After that was completed we had to edit the rows for our subtotal, tax, and total. We also used the document.write to do this. We used the toFixed function to ensure that our decimals don’t go past the decimal place we listed (2). </p>

<p> After completing Invoice 1 we now have Invoice 2. We needed to build on top of the invoice statement we created for Invoice 1. We added a shipping row and needed to get the shipping to calculate into the grand total. We also had to use the if condition to tell the site how much shipping would be depending on the cost. Lastly we had to use the style object to put the given paragraph at the bottom of our table.  Now moving onto SmartPhoneProducts2 we were tasked with editing the table for the smartphone products. We need to take the table that we were given and input into our head of the page within the script function. Once we did that we needed to create a loop in order to get the photos and price amounts of each product to correspond with each other. Creating a loop makes it easier if we need to make any changes, instead of having to go edit each product we are able to make the changes through the loop. </p>
 
  <b> BrowserHistory6: 19:41 </b>
<p> This browser history I had a hard time at first. I had to practice quite a few times. After testing and trying things, it became more familiar. Linking the button, onmouseover, onmouseclick was a part that I struggled with in the beginning but I was able to understand how to link it into the <li> tag. The part that I struggled the most with was getting the photos to get in the correct alignment that we were supposed to have. The images kept being right next to the paragraph instead of above. At the very end looking over my style sheet I noticed that I still had some leftover code within it which was causing the photo to not be in the correct alignment. </p> 

  <b> SmartPhoneProducts1: 8:23 </b>
<p> Moving onto SmartPhoneProducts1 this was quite easy for me to understand but I did have a hard time in the beginning with the using the search option. For some reason whenever I used the search bar to try to replace the <h2>, <p>, <img> it was bringing up no results found. I figured out I wasn’t using “ .*  “ in my search only clicking on the button. But once I fixed that it cleared up and I was able to find the <h2> ect and replace them with the code. The last part was easy for me, I understand why we moved the variables into a js and linked it to the html. I also was able to understand console.log more since it gave me a good example of why and how we used console.log. </p>

  <b> Invoice1: 19:17 </b>
<p> Now moving forward to Invoice1. Invoice was good practice with using comments. I haven’t really had to use comments until now. The comments helped me keep track of what product I was working on. It also helped me understand how to use variables more and how we can add variables together. It also helped me practice with strings. In the beginning I was struggling with getting the table into a string. But I figured out that I was using the single quotation instead of the backslash which is why everything was going red. I was able to do this WOD after two tries of filming. The first time with filming I got everything to show but the subtotal. It was showing me that the subtotal was working and creating the total but the number itself wasn’t showing up on the table. So I needed to stop the video and inspect my whole code. After looking it over for about 15 mins I was able to find my error using the insect option. I forgot a “t” when I was writing subtotal in my table row at the bottom in the document.write area. This is why it was added correctly but not showing up. Then I filmed again and was able to get it done within the Rx time. </p>

  <b> Invoice2: 7:32 </b>
<p> When doing my Invoice 2 I was able to get a better understanding of using the IF condition. I was confused at first on how to output an IF condition and the way to format it. But since the WOD task was quite simple I was able to see how and why we format it in such a way. It took me two tries, this is due to a minor error that I had the first time. When I was trying to output the subtotal to the table I typed “subotal” instead of subtotal which is why it the table was showing the correct calculation as if the subtotal was there but wasn’t showing up within my table. After stopping the clock it took about 15 minutes for me to spot this typo. After I fixed that my table was working. Then I was able to complete the WOD on my second try. </p>

  <b> SmartPhoneProducts2: 9:18 </b>
<p> Now working with SmartPhoneProducts2 was tricky at first for me because I didn't get the search format correct. After practicing how to use this tool a few times I understood how to highlight the whole row in order to make the change. When I went to attempt the filming of the WOD I realized that we were given the edited table and the search and replace tool wasn’t needed. This is why I was able to cut down so much time for the WOD. After realizing that the table was already given I was able to move onto creating the loop to make sure the products, their price, and pictures were able to be outputted to the webpage. Creating this loop helped me understand a bit better on how to use the greater than, less than, and equal statements. </p> 

  <b> How I plan do better for the incoming WODs </b>
<p> For these WODs the main thing I need to work on is being careful with my codes. One thing can throw it off and can stump me for a long time. I think if I use the inspection option more often to find my errors it will save me a lot of time. I think triple checking things is something I need to get more into the habit of. Because this affected me more than once in these WODs. </p>
