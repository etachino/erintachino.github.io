Summary of WODS 1-3
After going through WODs 1-3 I am going to give a brief summary of what I did for each WOD. Starting with WOD1 we were tasked with creating a webpage about different browsers that one can use. Within the webpage we had to create a table of contents and add an informational paragraph about each browser. To create the table of contents we had to use the a href tag so that the browsers knows which browser history we are looking for. We also used a href tag to hyperlink four web pages that we found and needed to link within the browser paragraph. After that we used the img src tag to add the photo links so that they would be displayed on the page. Moving onto WOD2, this was a continuation of WOD1. For this WOD we focused on changing the style of the page, such as font, font size, color of font, margins, and color of page background. We had to use the style.css in order to perform all these and then link the stylesheet to our index.html. Onto the last WOD, WOD3. We again used the last WOD, WOD2 to build off. In WOD3 we focused on the layout of the page. We had to move the browser text from a paragraph style to a side-by-side style layout. After changing the layout we removed the table of contents and created a horizontal bar of contents using the navbar tag. 
 
WOD1: 15:11 
When I started BrowserHistory1 I first started by watching the introduction video about how to set up my browserhistory. After that, I tried my first attempt with just following the steps to creating the website. In the beginning of the class I did have a hard time getting the server to turn on. After troubleshooting a few times I was able to get the server on. Something that really stumped me during the first Browserhistory was creating the table of contents. Combining the list function and the hyperlink function to work was confusing to me. I had to watch the screencast example to get me started with creating the correct table of contents. After practicing a few times when I recorded myself, I was able to finish in under 15 minutes. This first WOD really helped me understand how to create a basic webpage. Inputting the hyperlinks for the website was something that was on the easier side for me during BrowserHistory1. 

WOD2: 7:30 
Moving onto BrowserHistory2 this one was quite easy for me and I was able to finish it within the Rx time. I only had to practice a couple times before getting it down. Adding the edits like the background color and margin sizes were relatively simple. It was really neat to see how one change in the style.css can drastically change the look of the webpage. One issue that I did have with this BrowserHistory was linking the style sheet to the HTML and ensuring that I had the right font. I wasn’t able to find where the font link was. I had to use the screencast to get the link for the Oswald and Open Sans font. 

WOD3: 16:25 
Now moving forward to BrowserHistory3. This BrowserHistory did take me some time to go over the screencast video. I have never used the navbar function before so I needed to practice at least four times before being confident enough to film. I had trouble with how to get the links to be spaced out correctly. It was really cool to learn how using the navbar function with the style.css was able to manipulate the navbar I created in the index.html. This was also my first time moving around images so that they align correctly on the webpage. It was interesting to play around with the margin spaces and how to define where the images go using the float function. Once I was able to understand what functions I needed to use for this WOD I was able to complete it within the allotted time for the Rx. 

How I plan do better for the incoming WODs
Personally I felt pretty prepared when I needed to film for the WODs. When I first attempted the WOD without watching the screencast it was tricky and I had a good amount of mistakes. I also wasn’t able to complete it in the allotted time. After watching the videos I felt like they were well explained and helped me understand why this goes there and how this affects that. The one thing I would say that I could do better for the next WODs is keeping up with the schedule. In the beginning it was honestly quite hard to understand what needed to be turned in using the schedule on our website. Now as the semester is progressing I am understanding how the schedule works and what is expected. Another thing that I can improve on completing the essay portion closer to when I finished the WOD so that my experience is fresh.
