Summary of WODS 1-3
In WOD1 we had to create a web page and table of contents using a href to link the company names to their proper page and insight to the browser. Then we had to use the a href tag again but this time to hyperlink links we gathered for each company, ie, chrome, and firefox. We then covered how to link an image into each of the webpages for the different browsers by using the img src tag. For WOD2 we had to build on top of our WOD1. We were tasked with adding color and font to the webpage using style.css. We first had to link the stylesheet into our copy of index.html. We had to change the headings and non-headings to Oswald and Open Sans font using font-family. Then we changed the color of the body text to blue. We also changed the margins and the font width. Lastly we changed the background color to ivory and made sure the logo was aligned with the text. For the last WOD, WOD3, we built off WOD2. But instead of changing the color and alignment we had to change the layout of the webpage. We moved the browser text from paragraph style layout  to side by side layout including the images. We also had to remove the table of contents but keep the introduction. Once we removed the table of contents we had to make the list into a simple horizontal bar using the navbar tag. 
 
WOD1: 15:11 
When I started BrowserHistory1 I first started by watching the introduction video about how to set up my browserhistory. After that, I tried my first attempt with just following the steps to creating the website. In the beginning of the class I did have a hard time getting the server to turn on. After troubleshooting a few times I was able to get the server on. Something that really stumped me during the first Browserhistory was creating the table of contents. Combining the list function and the hyperlink function to work was confusing to me. I had to watch the screencast example to get me started with creating the correct table of contents. After practicing a few times when I recorded myself, I was able to finish in under 15 minutes. This first WOD really helped me understand how to create a basic webpage. Inputting the hyperlinks for the website was something that was on the easier side for me during BrowserHistory1. 

WOD2: 7:30 
Moving onto BrowserHistory2 this one was quite easy for me and I was able to finish it within the Rx time. I only had to practice a couple times before getting it down. Adding the edits like the background color and margin sizes were relatively simple. It was really neat to see how one change in the style.css can drastically change the look of the webpage. One issue that I did have with this BrowserHistory was linking the style sheet to the HTML and ensuring that I had the right font. I wasn’t able to find where the font link was. I had to use the screencast to get the link for the Oswald and Open Sans font. 

WOD3: 16:25 
Now moving forward to BrowserHistory3. This BrowserHistory did take me some time to go over the screencast video. I have never used the navbar function before so I needed to practice at least four times before being confident enough to film. I had trouble with how to get the links to be spaced out correctly. It was really cool to learn how using the navbar function with the style.css was able to manipulate the navbar I created in the index.html. This was also my first time moving around images so that they align correctly on the webpage. It was interesting to play around with the margin spaces and how to define where the images go using the float function. Once I was able to understand what functions I needed to use for this WOD I was able to complete it within the allotted time for the Rx. 

How I plan do better for the incoming WODs
Personally I felt pretty prepared when I needed to film for the WODs. When I first attempted the WOD without watching the screencast it was tricky and I had a good amount of mistakes. I also wasn’t able to complete it in the allotted time. After watching the videos I felt like they were well explained and helped me understand why this goes there and how this affects that. The one thing I would say that I could do better for the next WODs is keeping up with the schedule. In the beginning it was honestly quite hard to understand what needed to be turned in using the schedule on our website. Now as the semester is progressing I am understanding how the schedule works and what is expected. Another thing that I can improve on completing the essay portion closer to when I finished the WOD so that my experience is fresh.
