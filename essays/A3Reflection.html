  <hr>
  <p>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</p>
<p>My website features an assortment of cat products. The cat products range from cat towers to cat toys and scratchers. I have a selection of 6 different cat towers to choose from, I also have 6 different varieties of cat toy packs. I also have different types of cat scratchers that users can choose from. The scratchers come in many different shapes so the user can choose what best suits their home. My website allows the user to browse the pages and add items to cart before needing to login. The user is able to add more of the product they have selected or decrease the amount and the quantity will update dynamically.</p>
<p>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</p>
<p>The most notable shortcoming was that I wasn’t able to complete the edit user information, even though it is an extra credit for this assignment. It was something that I did want to get working without having the bug that it had for assignment 2. Unfortunately it did take longer than I expected to get everything else running so I wasn’t able to get to it.</p>
<p>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</p>
<p>What I am most proud of about my system is the website itself. I am happy that I got my website to run with all the necessary functions that were required. I am proud that I made it through this class and have completed everything to my best ability.</p>
<p>Describe what you are least happy with your system</p>
<p>I would say what I am least happy about with my system would be the design of it. CSS was harder for me than I thought. I would’ve liked to have it a bit nicer for the nav bar but overall I like the way my products are displayed.</p>
<p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</p>
<p>I felt like developing this assignment off of assignment 2 was not too different, this is because we did a lot of validation for assignment 2. I felt like a big bulk of the project was done in assignment 2 and assignment 3 focused more on implementing sessions and cookies. The main difference between assignment 2 and assignment 3 was adding the cart. The cart was a little tricky at times but I was able to get it to update dynamically.</p>
<p>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</p>
<p>When I ran into a problem I was able to collaborate with other classmates. We bounced ideas off each other and also told each other what lab examples they used to be able to fix the issues. I also fixed issues by using the internet, stack overflow has many great examples for what I needed to implement in this assignment.</p>
<p>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</p>
<p>Something that worked well in this assignment was the implementation of cookies and sessions. This was fairly easy to do using the examples we did in class. I believe that since we did a login and registration example in class it was a good reference. I was able to see how we add the cookies into the app.post login and register.</p>
<p>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</p>
<p>Something that did not work well while completing this assignment was my CSS. Taking the example from nav bar code it was hard to figure out how to add CSS around it since it was a function. But I was able to configure it to a place where the nav bar looks nice and functions correctly.</p>
<p>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</p>
<p>I learned how to understand sessions and cookies. By using the class examples it was easier to implement these and use them as references on how to integrate into my server. I have also gotten a better understanding of how to use functions to manipulate my page and have the cart to update dynamically.</p>
<p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</p>
<p>I would not change anything for this assignment. I feel like since my last assignment had a solid foundation it was easier to implement the new changes we needed to have.</p>
<p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</p>
<p>I would say for Assignment 3 I spent less time thinking about how to do something. I would give it about 20%. For writing code it was about 45%, and 35% testing and debugging my code.</p>
<p>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”) </p>
<p>I did not have a partner for this assignment.</p>
